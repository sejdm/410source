1. Prove that the fundamental groups of homotopically equivalent spaces are isomorphic.

2. Prove that a map $f: S^1 \to X$ is null homotopic if and only if it extends to a continuous map from the closed disc to $X$.

3. Prove  that the if $f : S^1 \to S^1$ satisfies the property that $f(-x) = -f(x)$, then the induced map $f_*$ is a non-trivial  homomorphism. Here we are treating $S^1$ as the subspace of unit complex numbers.

4. The projective plane may be defined as a space obtained by identifying each point in the 2-sphere with its antipodal point.
	a) Prove that the quotient map is a covering map.
	b) Use part a) to deduce the fundamental group of the projective plane.
	
5. Prove that $\pi_1(X, x_0) \times \pi_1(Y, y_0) \cong \pi_1(X\times Y, (x_0, y_0)$. 

6. Compute the fundamental group of the torus, $S^1 \times S^1$.

7. Consider the map $i : S^1 \to S^1 \times S^1$ defined by $i(x) = (x, 1)$. Prove that $i_*$ is an injective map between the respective fundamental groups.
