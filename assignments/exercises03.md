1. Prove that the fundamental groups of homotopically equivalent spaces are isomorphic.

2. Prove that a map $f: S^1 \to X$ is null homotopic if and only if it extends to a continuous map from the closed disc to $X$.

3. Prove  that the if $f : S^1 \to S^1$ satisfies the property that $f(-x) = -f(x)$, then the induced map $f_*$ is a non-trivial  homomorphism. Here we are treating $S^1$ as the subspace of unit complex numbers.
